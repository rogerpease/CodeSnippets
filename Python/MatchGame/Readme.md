Very simple game program I wrote a couple years ago. 

Steps:

1. Install pygame: pip3 install pygame 
2. Install Pillow: pip3 install Pillow    (only needed if you run MakeGIFs)
3. If you have pictures you'd like to use, mkdir images and put them in there. 
   Otherwise you can use MakeGIFs.py to make a few for you (just boring words). 
4) Run ./MatchGame.py
