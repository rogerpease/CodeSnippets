This is a demo program to show my approach to a problem of trying to evaluate different blackjack strategies. 

This took me about 3 hours to write. Obviously I will be improving it. :) 

BTW No I'm not much of a gambler but do enjoy the mathematical aspect.



How to execute: 

./PlayHands.py VeryBasicStrategy    
{'DealerWins': 39, 'PlayerWins': 22, 'Draw': 5}


TODO: 
    BasicStrategy.py 
    BasicCounting.py
