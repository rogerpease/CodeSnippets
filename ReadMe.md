These are some small programs I wrote to illustrate my programming skill and to keep personal notes on how 
to handle various proramming tasks. 

Ground Rules:
=============
    * These are very small. Most of the programming projects I've worked on are tens of thousands of lines of code. 
        That is less important than how I structure and document and use code as a communication tool.  
    * The point of these is to be the starting point of a conversation about coding skill. 
    * I typed in everything here. Obviously I borrowed some lines from Reference guides, StackOverflow, etc, 
          but the approaches are all mine (and I'm sure many others'). 
    * I know the background behind every line of code. Feel free to ask me about them. 
    * There is always a better way to do things. Any ideas on newer approaches are always welcome.
    * Different groups have different concerns and tradeoffs for readability, coding style, etc. 
      If you have different concerns I am happy to discuss and adapt (you may learn something from me too).  

Languages:
==========
My main languages are C, C++, Perl, Python and Javascript (NodeJS).

I've also done Lua, C#, Assembly, Verilog (used for FPGA development) and HTML.
