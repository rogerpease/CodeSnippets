These are some small programs I wrote to illustrate my programming skill.

Ground Rules:
=============
    * These are very small. Most of the programming projects I've worked on are tens of thousands of lines of code. 
        That is less important than how I structure and document and use code as a communication tool.  
    * The point of these is to be the starting point of a conversation about coding skill. I
    * I typed in everything here. Obviously I borrowed some lines from Reference guides, StackOverflow, etc, 
          but the approaches are all mine (and I'm sure many others'). 
    * I know the background behind every line of code. Feel free to ask me about them. 
    * There is always a better way to do things. Any ideas on newer approaches are always welcome.
    * Different groups have different concerns and tradeoffs for readability, coding style, etc. If you have different concerns I am happy to 
      discuss and adapt (you may learn something from me too).  

Languages:
==========
My main languages are C, C++, Perl, Python and Javascript (NodeJS).

I've also done: 
    * Lua 
    * C#  (as part of .NET4.0). C# is very similar to Java. 
    * Assembly (ARM and TMS320C6X)
    * HTML (I don't talk much about this as I haven't done the newer web design techniques and HTML isn't Turing Complete).
